    \section{Task1: reproduce the following model using Copasi}

    \subsection{Model description}
    A is produced from outside the system by constant, 0 order mass action kinetics. A is at steady state because
    A also undergoes degradation. Without stimulation by S, all that happens is that A finds a steady state. In
    the presence of S, A is reversibly converted to B. B stimulates the production of C which both undergoes
    spontaneous first order degradation and induces the degradation of B, thereby completing a negative feedback.
