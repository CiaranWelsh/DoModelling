    \section{Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Models}
    This section is dedicated to building, parameterising and simulating ODE models using the tools
    commonly used in systems biology. ODEs are widespread in science and you can build them yourselves
    using pretty much any programming environment. In systems biology however, we tend to let
    software abstract away the actual equation building in favour of a `biochemical centric' perspective. Regardless
    of how the equations are built, they are still all ODE models so you should be aware (though not necessarily an
    expert) of the maths involved in ODE modelling.
