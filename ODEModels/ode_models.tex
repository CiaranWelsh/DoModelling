    \section{Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Models}
    This section is dedicated to building, parameterising and simulating ODE models using the tools
    commonly used in systems biology. ODE's are widespread in science and you can build them yourselves
    using pretty much any programming environment. In systems biology however, we tend to let
    software abstract away the actual equation building in favour of an `biochemical centric' perspective. Regardless
    of how the equations are built, they are still all ODE models so you should be aware (though not necessarily an
    expert) of mathematics involved in ODE modelling. This is beyond the scope of these tutorials, but I'd advise you
    to make sure you understand the concept of numerical integration and optimization (though again, not necessarily how
    to actually code them).
